# IR_Assignment2

Current package contains a module of modelled Sawyer robot using DHRobot3D class from ir_support package. The module are able to interact with the robot with the included functions and still on developing state. The RMRC motion function has not been considering self_collision and defined object collision avoidance. 
A testing GUI is built in script sample.py which drag the button and slider function to mimic the interaction with user in a similar way to how a teach pendant work on another robot model. The button box still in a vertical order as default, which are needed to be modified by investigating package SwiftElement.
Further development for a different robot model will be updated to modify the package from Bruh_model.
